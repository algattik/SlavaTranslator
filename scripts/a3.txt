Conjugation
Notes on present tense forms:  is the only Russian present tense form. In works of literature, it can be used as a copula, as in Church Slavonic, for emphasis. Extremely rarely, Church Slavonic forms , , ,  ,  appear in some styles of literature. They are not understood by most speakers and normally aren't considered part of the language.  is the Church Slavonic 3rd person plural.

Usage notes
When used with numerals in a distributive sense, the following should be noted:

The case of the numeral is the dative for the numerals one, a thousand, a million, a billion, a trillion, etc. and compound numerals ending in these words, e.g. twenty-one, but the accusative inanimate (even with animate nouns) for the remainder.      .  I gave them five rubles each.        .  I gave them twenty-one rubles each.     .  We sent three men each. (note, not animate *) The case of an associated noun, if any, follows the normal rules for the numeral (dative singular for one and compounds ending in one; genitive singular for two, three, four and compounds ending in these numerals; and genitive plural in all other cases). With , ,  (but not compounds ending in these numerals), the stress is optionally drawn onto :     /  .  I gave them two rubles each.

Usage notes
When the genitive plural is needed after a (cardinal) number, the word  (the genitive plural of , meaning summer) is used instead of . This applies to numbers whose names do not end in  (1),  (2),  (3), or   (4) when in nominative, genitive, or accusative case (so this includes numbers like 114 whose name in Russian does not end in  ), as well as to numbers ending in , , or   in genitive case. To put this in another way, when a number should be followed by a nominative or genitive singular, the appropriate form of  is used. When a number should be followed by a genitive plural, the form  is used. When the number is in the dative, instrumental, or prepositional case, the appropriate form of  must be used. Examples:   (nominative singular),   (genitive singular),   (genitive singular),   (genitive plural); but    (genitive plural),    (genitive plural); and   (dative plural),   (instrumental plural), o   (prepositional plural). When used with an ordinal number, the above rules don't apply, and one simply uses the needed form of , for example,     ("At the beginning of the '90s")

Usage notes
The  form is unstressed except in the idiom   . When governing the prepositional case, the form  is used before consonants, except before a few clusters where the form  is used. When governing the accusative, the form  is used before most consonants in the written language: the usage is variable before liquids. In the spoken language,  is used in all cases.

An  is prefixed to any third-person pronoun in an oblique case whenever a preposition that directly governs it is immediately in front of it:   (from her),   (on him),   (they have),   (to him),   (with her). This comes from Russian prepositions such as  (su n, "with", cf. Greek , Latin cum), that originally ended in - and governed oblique cases. Since the prepositions and the pronouns occurred together so often, it was easy to lose track of which word the final - belonged to, and the  was reinterpreted as part of the pronouns (Old English an, in the same way, lost its -n except before vowels, and sometimes gave it to the following word, as in English adder from Old English nædre), so that   became modern  , and this new rule was extended to all prepositions governing any third-person pronoun. That if the preposition does not directly govern , ,  (i.e., when they are possessive pronouns), then no - is inserted:    (at his brother's),    (about her mother),    (in their room).

With expressions of time and order: emphasises promptitude: very, right, immediately, without delay      .  Right on the first page there was a mistake.       .  The very next day the work was finished.   !  Stop immediately!       .  After dinner she went straight to bed. 3. Marks an objection by pointing to the rationale behind said objection: after all, but    ?   !  Why don't you understand? After all, it's Russian! -  ,   . -   !  -I didn't know the exam was tomorrow. But I told you! 4. Especially in questions: expresses consequence of or reaction to what was said before: then, so  ?

Usage notes
Whenever a preposition stands immediately before any of the oblique cases of the third-person pronoun (singular or plural) and directly governs it, then an - must be prefixed to the pronoun:   (from him),   (on him),   (he has),   (to him),   (with him). The explanation for the -prothesis is that, originally, some Russian prepositions ended in the letter -:  (su n, "with"...cf. Greek , Latin cum).

Note that if the preposition does not directly govern  (i.e., when  is a possessive pronoun), then - is not prefixed:    (at his brother's),    (about his mother),    (in his room).

 and  , when in the nominative case or accusative case, even in compounds (22, 32, 42, 102, etc.), govern the genitive of the noun.    two boys (literally, "two of a boy")    two books (literally, "two of a book")     fifty-two boys (literally, "fifty-two of a boy") In the nominative case, all nouns become genitive singular. In the accusative case, animate nouns become genitive plural and inanimate nouns remain in genitive singular.  ,  ,        . Two dogs, two cats, two books and two journals fell from the table. ("" transforms all nouns from nominative to genitive singular.)    ,  ,     . I see two dogs, two cats, two books and two journals. (The verb "" governs accusative case, and "" transforms dogs and cats from accusative to genitive plural.)          . I downloaded two editors and invited two editors for lunch.   ,    . Grounding the two (electrical) conductors, the electrician saved the two (train) conductors. The reason behind the genitive singular here is that, in Old Russian,  governed the dual number, and the old nominative dual form was the same as the masculine genitive singular. When the dual number was lost in Russian, the form was reanalyzed as the genitive singular. This was extended to include the numbers  and  , and eventually it was applied by analogy to feminine nouns as well. While the noun in a nominative construction is in the genitive singular following  or , an intervening adjective or adjectival participle will be in the genitive plural or nominative plural If  is in nominative case, the adjective will be nominative plural when the noun is feminine    ,   ,       . Here are two big dogs, two big cats, two big books and two big tables. If  is in accusative case, the adjective will be the same as the nominative plural only if the noun is feminine inanimate

    ,   ,       . I see two big dogs, two big cats, two big books and two big tables. Another way of seeing this is: Nominative feminine is  + nominative plural adjective + genitive singular noun Nominative masculine is  + genitive plural adjective + genitive singular noun. Cases other than nominative and accusative (genitive, dative, instrumental, and prepositional) use plural forms, and agree in number and case with the noun. Accusative animate is the same as the genitive, and accusative inanimate is the same as the nominative.  and   obey the same rules.

Usage notes
The subordinate clause with  expresses an occurrence (i.e., an event, incident, news, or rumor) that happened in the past or that could possibly happen in the future. In this specific case, the main clause shows confirming or denying the occurrence (as described in the subordinate clause with ). For example:  ,    .  They will ask if Andrei has been on a holiday before. (The subordinate clause is an occurrence that happened in the past.)   ,    .  He will not say if he will stay home. (The subject of the main clause and the subordinate clause denotes the same person "he". The subordinate clause is an occurrence that could possibly happen in the future.) The main clause often has a verb that describes an occurrence, such as verbs pertaining to asking or talking. And also, depending on the context, the subordinate clause with  could be regarded as indirect speech. To make a sentence that expresses curiosity about a topic while using  in the subordinate clause, , .... is often used for the main clause. For example: () ,     .  ((I) am interested (wonder) if she will be at the party.   , ,  -     ! ,            -  !  I called a taxi, went outside, found it and my ride was almost stolen! Guess what, a guy had already been there and wondering if that was his cab. I said "that's my cab!" To make a sentence that expresses doubt about a topic while using  in the subordinate clause, (SUB)  , ...., (SUB)  , ...., (SUB) , ...., and  , .... are often used for the main clause. For example:   ,     -.  I don't know if my grandfather speaks Arabic. (The main clause shows a doubtful attitude by not knowing whether the old man speaks Arabic.)

  ,    .  I don't remember if I turned off the television. (The main clause shows a doubtful attitude by not remembering whether the television is turned off.)  ,     .  I doubt that I smoked cigarettes often. (The main clause shows a doubtful attitude by being skeptical about the smoking habit in the past.)  ,      .  It's difficult to tell that the volunteers understand the guidelines of this task. (The main clause shows a doubtful attitude by having a difficulty of explaining about the volunteers' situation.)

Usage notes
Do not confuse the noun or adjective  with  or , all of which translate to Russian. The word , an adjective, means pertaining to the state or country of Russia. The word , a noun, means a resident or citizen of Russia (regardless of the person's ethnic identity). Compare to the usage of English vs. British. Some speakers use the adjective  instead of  when referring to the country. Such usage is colloquial (or historical in some cases), ambiguous, and may be disrespectful to other ethnic groups in Russia; for example,  , "the Russian passport" and  , "the Russian capital" are preferred to   and   (expressions which may be seen as implying that other ethnic groups in the country don't have an equal right to the passport or have a different capital city). The expression  , "Russian athlete" unambiguously refers to an athlete from Russia, while   can often mean an athlete who is ethnically Russian, but not necessarily representing Russia.

Pronoun
 (masculine counterpart , feminine counterpart ) 1. it (third-person neuter singular pronoun)

Usage notes
Whenever a preposition stands immediately before any of the oblique cases of the third-person pronoun (singular or plural) and directly governs it, then an - must be prefixed to the pronoun:   (from it),   (on it),   (it has),   (to it),   (with it). The explanation for this -prothesis is that, originally, some Russian prepositions ended in the letter -:  (su n, "with"...cf. Greek , Latin cum). Eventually, the final  of these prepositions migrated across to the pronoun, so that   became modern  , and then this was generalized to include all prepositions when governing any third-person pronoun. Note that if the preposition does not directly govern  (i.e., when  is a possessive pronoun), then - is not prefixed:    (in its position),    (about its fabric),    (with its weight). When there is another word separating a preposition and any oblique case of , the - is not added:    (with it itself).

Usage notes
The personal pronoun  is comparable to French tu, German du, and is used only with family and intimate friends.

For most occasions, the formal  should be used instead. For more information, see Appendix:Russian pronouns.

Verb
 pf (imperfective ) 1. 2. 3. 4. to have time, to find time to manage (to do something), to succeed to arrive in time (for), to be in time (for) to catch (a train, bus)

Usage notes
One of the notable ways to use the verb  is to indicate two events happening subsequently in a sudden way. The main clause includes  /// and the subordinate clause starts with . For example:         ,      . Just as he (almost) finished his work on a computer, a blackout occurred in the building. The main clause has an additional perfective infinitive verb due to the finite verb, , also being perfective. Thus, the main clause evokes an action that intends to reach completion, but is suddenly interrupted with another event (as described by the main clause). Thus, the two subsequent events may be slightly overlapped with each other or lack any interval.

Numeral
 1. two (in a group together), two of them    two children    two watches    two pairs of glasses     two of us      there were two of us

Usage notes
The nominative of a collective numeral governs the genitive plural of the noun, pronoun, or adjective. For the other cases the noun, pronoun, or adjective will be in the same case (except when meaning "a pair of"). Not used with feminine nouns. Used mostly when speaking of children and with a few nouns that are used in the plural only, such as  , , or with pronouns. Examples: In the nominative, governing a genitive plural:     . Two guys came to meet me.     . I have two (pairs of) scissors. (literally, "With me are two (pairs of) scissors.") In the accusative, governing a genitive plural when meaning "a pair of":      . You need to take a pair of socks with you. In the accusative, governing an accusative plural when meaning "two":     . I met two of my colleagues there.
